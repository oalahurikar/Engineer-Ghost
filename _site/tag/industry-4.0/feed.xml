      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Rapid-prototyping">&lt;p&gt;Integrating Solidworks assembly into controls environment will allow rapid prototyping, testing and improve parallel development process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is possible by Interfacing Labview NI SoftMotion or Simscape multibody dynamics with Solidworks motion simulation. Where one can easily import solidworks design into Simulink or labview environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motion simulation- also known as rigid body dynamics provides complete, quantitative information about the kinematics—including position, velocity, and acceleration, and the dynamics— including joint reactions, inertial forces, and power requirements, of all the components of a moving mechanism from CAD design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/6f5b3ljtzewazy7/Multibody.JPG?dl=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This integration will allow development and testing of controls software against CAD design. And CAD or FEA design against controls system. Which will eventually accelerate product design and software development process.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/Convolution-neural-network-and-quality-control">&lt;p&gt;Quality control and assurance in manufacturing is demanding and expensive, yes, but also crucial. After all, selling flawed goods results in returns and disappointed customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harnessing the power of neural networks may significantly reduce the cost of visual quality control while also boosting overall process efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2018/03/11/10-ways-machine-learning-is-revolutionizing-manufacturing-in-2018/#3f93487723ac&quot;&gt;“Forbes”&lt;/a&gt;
, automating quality control with machine learning can increase defect detection rates up to 90%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ow006lzstpc0tf1/CNN.JPG?dl=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence may enhance the company’s ability to spot flawed products. Instead of embedding complex and lengthy lists of possible flaws into an algorithm, the convolutional neural network learns the product’s features. With the vision of the perfect product, the CNN can easily spot imperfect ones. The solution can learn continuously by taking feedback from manual inspectors who can review the automated classification and override them based on human judgment. The corrective information along with the image from the production floor is then included in the next training cycle for CNN model, thereby improving its ability to recognize in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
