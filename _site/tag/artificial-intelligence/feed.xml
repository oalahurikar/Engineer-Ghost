&lt;p&gt;Harnessing the power of neural networks may significantly reduce the cost of quality control while also boosting overall process efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2018/03/11/10-ways-machine-learning-is-revolutionizing-manufacturing-in-2018/#3f93487723ac&quot;&gt;“Forbes”&lt;/a&gt;
, automating quality control with machine learning can increase defect detection rates up to 90%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of embedding complex and lengthy lists of possible flaws into an algorithm, the convolutional neural network learns the product’s features. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is branch of artificial intelligence which learns image features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ow006lzstpc0tf1/CNN.JPG?dl=0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CNN can learn product features continuously by taking feedback images from manual inspectors who can review the automated classification and override them based on human judgment. The corrective information along with the image from the production floor is then included in the next training cycle for CNN model, thereby improving its accuracy and performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
