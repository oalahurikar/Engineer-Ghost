In past NASA used to have physical twin of rocket as back up if things go south.

Similarly, digital twin is digital representation of actual system or model of the device.

It can also be visualized as integration between system design,
["MBD"](https://merudynamics.com/mbd) and IOT. Digital twin can extend further, where it acts as middleware for end-to-end development cycle. Further real-time data from sensor of machine or its environment help to analyze data and to optimize the product.
